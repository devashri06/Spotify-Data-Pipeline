# Spotify-Data-Pipeline
Spotify Data Pipeline - Data Engineering Project using Python, AWS and Snowflake

The project aims to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) music streaming data from platforms like Spotify. The pipeline will leverage cloud services like AWS Lambda to automate data extraction from APIs. It will apply transformation logic to process the raw data into analytics-ready formats. The processed data will be loaded into a cloud data warehouse such as Snowflake for storage and analysis. By automating the ETL process, this pipeline will enable efficient and scalable data ingestion to support music analytics use cases.
